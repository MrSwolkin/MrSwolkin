Hey there, I'm Erick Swolkin, a 31-year-old professional ballet dancer hailing from Brazil. For over a decade, I performed as a demi-soloist for the highly acclaimed Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. However, due to political tensions, I had to leave and join the Sttatsballet Berlin company, where I currently dance.

Lately, I've been pursuing an old dream of mine - learning a Full Stack Python course. Although I'm not an expert in the field, I believe that my discipline, strong desire to learn, and persistence - which have helped me excel in my current career - will aid me in making this transition productive and enjoyable.

I'm excited about the opportunity to work with a highly skilled team, expand my knowledge and skills, and grow my network to achieve my goals.

Please accept mine sincere gratitude for your time and consideration.

Sicerely, Erick Swolkin.
